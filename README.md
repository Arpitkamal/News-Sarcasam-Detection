# News Sarcasma Detection

In this Repository help you to understand how to use `Recurrent Neural Network` (RNN) and `Long short-term memory` to classify text. 

I took [News Sarcasam Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection) from Kaggle to predict whether Headline is Sarcastic or not Sarcastic. 

To see RNN and LSTM working you can clone and run `News_Sarcasam_data.ipynb` file in your local machine.
